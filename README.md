# Quote-generator
This application fetches a new random quote from an API, upon the click of a button, and displays it in the browser.
Our Random quote generator project contains three parts: 
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
So first we need to create three files, 
The first one is HTML File(index.html), 
The second one is CSS file(style.css) and 
The third one is JS file(index.js).
